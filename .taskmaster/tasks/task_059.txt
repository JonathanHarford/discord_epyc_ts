# Task ID: 59
# Title: Enhance Season Join Feedback with Contextual Information
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 8, 40, 42
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the season joining success message to provide contextual information about the season's status and expected start time, leveraging the rich data returned by the SeasonService.
# Details:
Update the handlers for joining a season (`/join season` command, button, and select menu) to utilize the comprehensive data returned by `SeasonService.addPlayerToSeason` (implemented in Task 7 and relying on Task 5). This service method already provides relevant information like `currentPlayers`, `playersNeeded`, `timeRemaining`, and the appropriate message key (`joinSuccess`, `joinSuccessPlayersNeeded`, `joinSuccessTimeRemaining`) based on the season's state and activation trigger (Task 8, Task 42).

Instead of implementing complex conditional logic within the handlers, the task is to:

1.  Replace the basic string replacement with logic that uses the specific message key returned by `SeasonService.addPlayerToSeason`.
2.  Utilize the `interpolate()` function to populate the message template with the relevant data returned by the service (e.g., `seasonId`, `currentPlayers`, `playersNeeded`, `timeRemaining`).
3.  Use the enhanced messaging utility (`SimpleMessage.sendSuccess()` from Task 40) to construct and send the feedback message, potentially including embeds if beneficial.
4.  Ensure date/time formatting for `timeRemaining` (if applicable) is user-friendly, potentially using `formatTimeRemaining()`.
5.  Apply these enhancements to the chat command handler (`src/commands/chat/season-command.ts`), the season join button handler (`src/handlers/seasonJoinButtonHandler.ts`), and the season select menu handler (`src/handlers/seasonSelectMenuHandler.ts`).
6.  Review `src/lang/strings.ts` to ensure existing message templates (`strings.messages.season.*`) are sufficient or enhance them if necessary to support the required context.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Test joining a season via the `/join season` command when the season is OPEN and `current_players` < `min_players`. Verify the success message uses the `joinSuccessPlayersNeeded` key and correctly interpolates `playersNeeded`.
2.  Test joining a season via the `/join season` command when the season is OPEN and `current_players` >= `min_players` and `open_duration` is set. Verify the success message uses the `joinSuccessTimeRemaining` key and correctly interpolates `timeRemaining` with user-friendly formatting.
3.  Test joining a season via the `/join season` command when the season is OPEN and `current_players` >= `min_players` and `open_duration` is not set (season starts immediately). Verify the success message uses the `joinSuccess` key and provides appropriate feedback.
4.  Repeat tests 1-3 using the season join button handler.
5.  Repeat tests 1-3 using the season select menu handler.
6.  Verify that the current player count (`currentPlayers`) is included in the message where relevant (e.g., alongside players needed).
7.  Test joining seasons in other states (if the join command/handlers allow) to ensure feedback is handled gracefully (e.g., appropriate error message if joining is not allowed).
