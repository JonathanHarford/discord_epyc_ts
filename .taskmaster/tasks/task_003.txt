# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Configuration Loading
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the application to load critical configuration settings (client ID, client token, guild ID, database URL) from environment variables instead of configuration files. Ensure these environment variables are loaded correctly, potentially using an `.env` file or similar mechanism, and are accessible throughout the application.
# Details:
The following configuration values should be loaded from environment variables:
- `CLIENT_ID`
- `CLIENT_TOKEN`
- `GUILD_ID`
- `DATABASE_URL`

Consider using a library like `dotenv` to facilitate loading from an `.env` file during development, while ensuring it works correctly when variables are set directly in the environment (e.g., in production or via `.cursor/mcp.json`).

# Test Strategy:
Create an `.env` file or set environment variables directly with sample values for `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_TOKEN`, `GUILD_ID`, and `DATABASE_URL`. Run the application and verify that these values are loaded correctly and used in the appropriate parts of the code (e.g., connecting to the database, initializing the Discord client).
