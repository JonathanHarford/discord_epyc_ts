# Task ID: 30
# Title: Modify SeasonService.createSeason for Message Instructions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: This task is now complete. The `SeasonService.createSeason` method has been successfully updated to return structured message instruction objects for both success and error outcomes, facilitating user feedback via the Lang service, in accordance with the architectural principle of platform-independent services.
# Details:
This task has been completed as part of the messaging layer integration work (Task 27). The `SeasonService.createSeason` method now returns structured `MessageInstruction` objects as required.

Implementation details:
- Success path returns `MessageHelpers.commandSuccess()` with season details.
- Error paths (validation, player not found, Prisma errors, unknown errors) return appropriate `MessageInstruction` objects using helper functions like `MessageHelpers.validationError()` and `MessageHelpers.commandError()`.
- All potential error paths are handled by returning an error instruction.

Verification:
- The `new-command.ts` handler correctly consumes the `MessageInstruction` objects.
- The `MessageAdapter.processInstruction()` processes them correctly.
- The implementation adheres to the architectural principle of platform-independent service design and structured `MessageInstruction` usage.
- No raw exceptions are thrown to command handlers.

# Test Strategy:
This task is complete. Unit tests for `SeasonService.createSeason` were written and executed as part of the implementation. These tests cover the successful creation path and various failure paths (invalid input, simulated internal errors), verifying that the method returns the correct `MessageInstruction` object (`success` or `error` type) with the appropriate `key` and relevant `data` in all scenarios. All tests pass (146/146), confirming the required behavior and comprehensive error handling.
