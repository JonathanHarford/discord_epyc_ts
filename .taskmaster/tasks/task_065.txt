# Task ID: 65
# Title: Refine Turn Claim Messages and Timeout Display
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 9, 10, 37, 62
# Priority: medium
# Description: The redundant 'claimed' message when players claim initiating turns has been successfully removed. The timeout display for claimed turns was found to be already correctly implemented using the format from Task 62.
# Details:
The code responsible for sending the redundant 'claimed' message immediately after a player successfully claims an initiating turn via DM has been modified. Specifically, the message edit that previously showed the redundant status has been replaced with a clean deletion of the original turn offer message. A simple ephemeral acknowledgment is now provided to the user upon successful claim. Upon investigation, the logic for displaying claim timeout messages and status updates was already correctly calculating and displaying the time remaining using `FormatUtils.formatRemainingTime()` from Task 62, so no changes were required for this part of the task.

# Test Strategy:
1. Initiate a game and offer a turn to a player. 2. Have the player claim the turn via DM. Verify that the original turn offer message is deleted and an ephemeral confirmation message ('✅ Turn claimed! Check your DMs for instructions.') is received. Verify that no redundant 'claimed' message appears in the channel. 3. Check the DM received for the claimed turn. Verify that it displays the actual time remaining until the claim timeout (e.g., '5m 30s remaining') and that the duration counts down correctly. 4. Allow a claimed turn to approach its timeout and verify the displayed duration remains accurate in the DM and any subsequent notifications. 5. Ensure other game messages and timeout displays (like submission timeouts) are unaffected and continue to display durations correctly.
