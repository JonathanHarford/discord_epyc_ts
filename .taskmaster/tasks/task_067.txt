# Task ID: 67
# Title: Fix 2-Person Season Turn Passing After Initial Turns
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14, 36, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Address the bug preventing automatic turn passing in 2-person seasons after both players submit their initial turns. The root cause is identified as a missing trigger for the next turn offering within the `SeasonTurnService` after a turn is completed or skipped and the game is not yet finished.
# Details:
Investigate the `SeasonTurnService.ts` file, specifically the `submitTurn` and `skipTurn` methods. The current logic correctly checks for game completion after a turn, but it fails to trigger the `TurnOfferingService.offerNextTurn()` call when the game is *not* completed. This omission prevents the system from offering the next turn, particularly noticeable in 2-person seasons after the second turn is completed, leading to the game stalling instead of offering the third turn to the first player. The fix involves adding the appropriate call to `TurnOfferingService.offerNextTurn(gameId, 'turn_completed')` or `TurnOfferingService.offerNextTurn(gameId, 'turn_skipped')` within the conditional block where the game is determined to be not completed. Affected code is primarily within the turn processing logic in `SeasonTurnService.ts` (approximate lines ~290-400 for `submitTurn` and ~490-620 for `skipTurn`). Ensure the fix correctly handles turn progression in 2-person games and does not negatively impact other game types or stages.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test scenario specifically for a 2-person season. Start a new 2-person season. Have both players submit their initial turns. Verify that after the second player submits their turn, the system automatically offers the third turn to the first player. Confirm that the game does not stall and the turn state progresses correctly. Test with different players and ensure consistency. Also, briefly test skipping a turn in a 2-person game to ensure the fix applies there as well.
