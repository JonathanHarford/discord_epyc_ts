# Task ID: 5
# Title: Establish Core Service and Pure Logic Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the initial structure for the service layer (`src/services/`) and pure game logic functions (`src/game/`). Define placeholder classes/files for `SeasonService`, `GameService`, `PlayerService`, `TurnService` and basic function signatures based on the required operations (create season, add player, claim turn, submit turn, etc.).
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Verify that the required directories and files are created with basic class/function definitions. Ensure they can be imported without errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Directories [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the main directory structure to house service classes and pure game logic functions. [Updated: 5/11/2025] [Updated: 5/11/2025]
### Details:
Create directories such as '/services' and '/game_logic' (or similar naming conventions) at the appropriate level within the project structure.
<info added on 2025-05-11T22:08:00.047Z>
Create the following directories at the root of the 'src' folder to organize core project components: 'src/services' for all service classes and related utilities, and 'src/game' for pure game logic functions, core game systems, and related modules. This structure supports modularity, clear separation of concerns, and easy navigation for future development and maintenance. Ensure directory names are consistent and do not use spaces or special characters. This foundational setup will facilitate the creation of service class placeholder files and further logic implementation in subsequent subtasks.

Directory structure has been established as follows: 'src/services' already existed and was confirmed to be in place; 'src/game' was newly created to house all pure game logic functions, core game systems, and related modules. This structure supports modularity, clear separation of concerns, and easy navigation for future development and maintenance. Directory names are consistent and do not use spaces or special characters. This foundational setup will facilitate the creation of service class placeholder files and further logic implementation in subsequent subtasks.
<info added on 2025-05-11T22:08:00.047Z>
The 'src/services' directory is intended for all service classes and related utilities, while 'src/game' is dedicated to pure game logic, core systems, and modular components. This separation ensures that service-related code and game logic are kept distinct, supporting maintainability and scalability as the project grows. Future subtasks will focus on populating these directories with placeholder files and implementing core logic.

## 2. Create Service Class Placeholder Files [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Generate empty or minimal placeholder files for anticipated service classes within the designated service directory.
### Details:
Based on initial project design, identify potential service classes (e.g., 'UserService', 'GameService') and create corresponding files (e.g., 'user_service.py', 'game_service.py') inside the '/services' directory.
<info added on 2025-05-11T22:09:09.340Z>
Based on initial project design, identify potential service classes and create corresponding files inside the '/services' directory. For this subtask, create the following minimal TypeScript class files in the 'src/services' directory: 'SeasonService.ts' with an empty or minimal class definition for SeasonService, 'GameService.ts' for GameService, 'PlayerService.ts' for PlayerService, and 'TurnService.ts' for TurnService. Each file should export a class with the same name as the file, ready for future implementation of business logic and data handling. These service classes will serve as foundational components for encapsulating core application logic and API interactions, following TypeScript best practices for class structure and modularity[1][5].

<update timestamp="2025-05-11T22:09:04Z">
The following files should be created as minimal class placeholders:
- src/services/SeasonService.ts: export class SeasonService {}
- src/services/GameService.ts: export class GameService {}
- src/services/PlayerService.ts: export class PlayerService {}
- src/services/TurnService.ts: export class TurnService {}

<info added on 2025-05-11T22:10:08.793Z>
Based on initial project design, placeholder files for core service classes have been created in the 'src/services' directory. Each file contains a minimal TypeScript class definition, following best practices for modularity and future extensibility. The following files are now in place and ready for further implementation:
- src/services/SeasonService.ts: export class SeasonService {}
- src/services/GameService.ts: export class GameService {}
- src/services/PlayerService.ts: export class PlayerService {}
- src/services/TurnService.ts: export class TurnService {}

These classes serve as foundational components for encapsulating core application logic and API interactions, and are prepared for the next phase of business logic and data handling implementation[1][5].

- src/services/SeasonService.ts: export class SeasonService {}
- src/services/GameService.ts: export class GameService {}
- src/services/PlayerService.ts: export class PlayerService {}
- src/services/TurnService.ts: export class TurnService {}

## 3. Create Game Logic Placeholder Files [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Generate empty or minimal placeholder files for anticipated pure game logic functions within the designated game logic directory.
### Details:
Identify potential modules for pure game logic functions (e.g., 'game_rules', 'math_utils') and create corresponding files (e.g., 'game_rules.py', 'math_utils.py') inside the '/game_logic' directory.
<info added on 2025-05-11T22:10:34.398Z>
Identify and create placeholder files for core game logic modules in the '/src/game' directory. Each file should contain minimal function stubs for anticipated logic, ensuring clear separation of concerns and easy future expansion. Specifically, create the following files and functions:

- **seasonLogic.ts**: Contains `createSeasonPlaceholder()` to initialize or reset season-related game state.
- **playerLogic.ts**: Contains `addPlayerPlaceholder()` to handle player addition logic.
- **turnLogic.ts**: Contains `claimTurnPlaceholder()`, `submitTurnPlaceholder()`, `offerTurnPlaceholder()`, `skipTurnPlaceholder()`, and `dismissOfferPlaceholder()` to manage turn lifecycle and player actions.
- **gameLogic.ts**: Contains `activateSeasonPlaceholder()`, `nextPlayerLogicPlaceholder()`, `checkGameCompletionPlaceholder()`, and `checkSeasonCompletionPlaceholder()` to orchestrate game flow, player rotation, and completion checks.

These files should be placed in the '/src/game' directory and serve as the foundation for implementing pure game logic, following best practices for modularity and maintainability.

Placeholder files and functions have been created in `src/game/` as specified. Each file contains minimal stubs for the listed functions, providing a clear structure for future logic implementation. This modular approach supports separation of concerns, making it easier to expand and maintain the game logic as development progresses. The structure aligns with best practices for organizing pure logic modules, ensuring that each file and function is focused on a single responsibility and can be independently tested and updated.
