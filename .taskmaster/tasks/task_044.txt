# Task ID: 44
# Title: Implement /admin season config Command for Default Settings
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 43
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `/admin season config` command to manage the server's default season configuration, allowing admins to view or update settings like min/max players and timeouts.
# Details:
Implement the handler for the `/admin season config` slash command. This command should reside under the `/admin season` subcommand structure established in Task 43. Define optional parameters for common season configuration settings such as `min_players`, `max_players`, `open_duration_hours`, `pending_duration_hours`, `game_duration_days`, `turn_duration_hours`, and `max_skipped_turns`. The command should parse these optional parameters.

If no parameters are provided, retrieve the current server default season configuration using a dedicated service method (e.g., `ConfigService.getDefaultSeasonConfig`). Format the retrieved configuration into a clear, readable message and send it back to the admin using the messaging layer.

If one or more parameters are provided, validate the input values. If validation passes, call a service method (e.g., `ConfigService.updateDefaultSeasonConfig`) to update the corresponding settings in the database for the server's default configuration. Use the messaging layer to send a success message confirming the update, listing the parameters that were changed. If validation fails, send an informative error message.

Ensure this command strictly interacts with the *default* configuration stored at the server level and does not modify any specific, active, or past season instances.

# Test Strategy:
1. Register the updated slash commands.
2. Execute `/admin season config` with no parameters. Verify that the command returns a message listing the current default season configuration values.
3. Execute `/admin season config` with one or more valid parameters (e.g., `/admin season config min_players: 3 max_players: 10`). Verify that the command returns a success message indicating the parameters were updated.
4. Query the database directly (or via another command/tool if available) to confirm that the default season configuration values for the server have been updated correctly.
5. Execute `/admin season config` with invalid parameters (e.g., non-numeric values, values outside reasonable ranges). Verify that the command returns an appropriate validation error message and that the database configuration is unchanged.
6. Create a new season after updating the default config. Verify that the new season inherits the updated default settings.
7. Check an existing season's configuration (if possible via another command or database query) to confirm that this command did not alter its settings.
