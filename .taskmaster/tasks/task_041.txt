# Task ID: 41
# Title: Refactor Game Logic Functions to Pure Functions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 36
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor all game logic functions in src/game/ to be pure, removing direct database queries and updates, and restructuring their interfaces to accept data as parameters and return results or update instructions.
# Details:
Identify all functions in src/game/gameLogic.ts, src/game/playerLogic.ts, src/game/turnLogic.ts, and src/game/seasonLogic.ts that currently perform database operations (queries or updates). For each function, remove any direct database access so that the function becomes a pure function: it should only compute based on its input parameters and return a result or a set of instructions describing what updates should be made. Update function signatures to accept all necessary data as arguments (e.g., gameData, seasonData, playerData, etc.), and ensure that any required database queries are performed in the calling service layer before invoking the pure function. Similarly, ensure that any database updates are performed after the pure function returns, based on its output. Where necessary, break up large or complex functions into smaller, composable pure functions. Update all service layer code that calls these functions to handle data fetching and persistence outside the pure logic layer. Document the new function signatures and provide clear guidance on the separation of concerns between the pure logic and service layers. Consider edge cases where pure functions may need to return structured instructions for updates rather than performing them directly. Ensure that the refactoring does not introduce awkward or convoluted patterns, and prefer clarity and testability over strict adherence to functional purity if it would harm maintainability[2][3].

# Test Strategy:
Write or update unit tests for each refactored pure function, ensuring they are fully testable with simple data structures and without any database dependencies. For each function, provide tests that cover all relevant input scenarios and verify that the output matches expected results or update instructions. Additionally, write integration tests for the service layer to ensure that database queries and updates are correctly orchestrated before and after pure function calls. Use code coverage tools to confirm that all logic branches are exercised. Review the codebase to ensure that no database operations remain in the pure logic layer and that all such operations are handled in the service layer. Validate that the refactoring improves testability and code clarity without introducing regressions[1][2].

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and Isolate Impure Game Logic Functions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all functions in src/game/gameLogic.ts, src/game/playerLogic.ts, src/game/turnLogic.ts, and src/game/seasonLogic.ts to identify those that perform direct database queries or updates. Document each impure function and its dependencies.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive list of all functions that interact with the database, noting their current signatures and side effects. This will serve as the foundation for refactoring.

## Analysis Complete: Impure Game Logic Functions Identified

I've analyzed all game logic files and identified the following functions that perform database operations:

### src/game/gameLogic.ts
**Functions with Database Queries:**
1. `activateSeasonPlaceholder(seasonId, prisma)` - Queries season + games, updates season + game status
2. `selectNextPlayer(gameId, turnType, prisma)` - Complex queries for game, season, players, and all season games
3. `checkGameCompletion(gameId, prisma)` - Queries game with season, players, and turns
4. `checkSeasonCompletion(seasonId, prisma, seasonService?)` - Queries season with games, updates season status

**Pure Helper Functions (already pure):**
- `calculatePlayerStats()` - Pure function that processes data
- `applyMustRules()` - Pure function
- `applyShouldRules()` - Pure function
- `applyShouldRule1()` - Pure function
- `applyShouldRule2()` - Pure function
- `applyShouldRule3()` - Pure function
- `applyShouldRule4()` - Pure function

### src/game/playerLogic.ts
**Functions with Database Operations:**
1. `addPlayerPlaceholder(discordUserId, name, prisma)` - Queries for existing player, creates or updates player

### src/game/turnLogic.ts
**Functions with Database Operations:**
1. `claimTurnPlaceholder(turnId, playerId, prisma)` - Queries turn, updates turn status
2. `submitTurnPlaceholder(turnId, playerId, submissionData, prisma)` - Queries turn, updates turn with submission
3. `offerTurnPlaceholder(turnId, playerId, prisma)` - Queries turn, updates turn status to offered
4. `skipTurnPlaceholder(turnId, prisma)` - Queries turn, updates turn status to skipped
5. `dismissOfferPlaceholder(turnId, playerIdWhoWasOffered, prisma)` - Queries turn, reverts turn to available

### src/game/seasonLogic.ts
**Functions with Database Operations:**
1. `createSeasonPlaceholder(creatorId, configId, prisma)` - Creates new season record

## Summary
**Total Impure Functions to Refactor: 9**
- 4 in gameLogic.ts
- 1 in playerLogic.ts
- 4 in turnLogic.ts
- 1 in seasonLogic.ts

**Already Pure Functions: 6** (helper functions in gameLogic.ts)

The analysis shows a clear pattern where functions either perform database operations OR are pure logic functions. The refactoring will separate these concerns completely.

## 2. Define Data Types and Pure Function Interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Design clear TypeScript interfaces/types for all data structures required by the pure functions. Specify new function signatures that accept data as parameters and return results or update instructions.
### Details:
Collaborate with the team to finalize data models and ensure all necessary information is passed explicitly to pure functions. Document these interfaces for future reference.
<info added on 2025-05-25T19:09:40.377Z>
## Data Types and Pure Function Interfaces Defined

I've successfully created comprehensive TypeScript types and interfaces for the pure game logic functions:

### Created Files:

**1. `src/game/types.ts`** - Complete type definitions including:
- **Core Data Types**: `GameWithRelations`, `SeasonWithRelations`, `TurnWithPlayer`, `PlayerWithStats`
- **Input Types**: `SelectNextPlayerInput`, `CheckGameCompletionInput`, `CheckSeasonCompletionInput`, etc.
- **Result Types**: `SelectNextPlayerResult`, `GameCompletionResult`, `SeasonCompletionResult`, etc.
- **Operation Results**: `SeasonActivationResult`, `PlayerOperationResult`, `TurnOperationResult`
- **Validation Types**: `TurnValidationResult`, `PlayerValidationResult`
- **Helper Types**: Enums for `TurnType`, `TurnStatus`, `SeasonStatus`, `GameStatus`

**2. `src/game/pureGameLogic.ts`** - Function interface definitions for:
- **Game Logic Functions**: `selectNextPlayerPure`, `checkGameCompletionPure`, `activateSeasonPure`
- **Player Logic Functions**: `processPlayerOperationPure`, `validatePlayerDataPure`
- **Turn Logic Functions**: Validation and processing functions for claim, submit, offer, skip, dismiss operations
- **Season Logic Functions**: `validateSeasonCreationPure`, `processSeasonCreationPure`
- **Helper Functions**: All the already-pure functions from gameLogic.ts that will be moved

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Separation of Validation and Processing**: Each operation has separate validation and processing functions for better modularity
2. **Structured Results**: All functions return structured results with success/error states and optional update instructions
3. **Database Update Instructions**: Functions return `DatabaseUpdateInstruction[]` arrays instead of performing updates directly
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types ensure compile-time safety and better IDE support
5. **Extensibility**: The type system is designed to be easily extended for future game logic needs

### Function Mapping:
- `activateSeasonPlaceholder` → `activateSeasonPure`
- `selectNextPlayer` → `selectNextPlayerPure`
- `checkGameCompletion` → `checkGameCompletionPure`
- `checkSeasonCompletion` → `checkSeasonCompletionPure`
- `addPlayerPlaceholder` → `processPlayerOperationPure`
- `claimTurnPlaceholder` → `validateTurnClaimPure` + `processTurnClaimPure`
- `submitTurnPlaceholder` → `validateTurnSubmissionPure` + `processTurnSubmissionPure`
- `offerTurnPlaceholder` → `validateTurnOfferPure` + `processTurnOfferPure`
- `skipTurnPlaceholder` → `validateTurnSkipPure` + `processTurnSkipPure`
- `dismissOfferPlaceholder` → `validateDismissOfferPure` + `processDismissOfferPure`
- `createSeasonPlaceholder` → `validateSeasonCreationPure` + `processSeasonCreationPure`

All function signatures are defined and ready for implementation in the next subtask.

## 3. Implement Pure Functions and Modularize Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 41.2
### Description: Refactor each identified impure function into a pure function, moving them into new files/modules (e.g., pureGameLogic.ts, pureTurnLogic.ts). Remove all direct database access and ensure functions only compute based on input parameters.
### Details:
Break up large or complex functions into smaller, composable pure functions where appropriate. Ensure each function returns results or structured update instructions.

Helper Functions (moved from gameLogic.ts):
- calculatePlayerStats - Calculates comprehensive player statistics
- applyMustRules - Applies hard constraints to filter eligible players
- applyShouldRules - Applies prioritization rules in sequence
- applyShouldRule1 - Prevents same player following pattern more than once
- applyShouldRule2 - Limits players to n/2 turns of same type
- applyShouldRule3 - Prefers players with fewest turns of given type
- applyShouldRule4 - Prefers players with fewer pending turns

Main Game Logic Functions:
- selectNextPlayerPure - Pure version of selectNextPlayer with full rule implementation

<info added on 2025-05-25T21:16:52.499Z>
## Service Layer Update to Pure Functions - COMPLETED ✅

After thorough analysis of the codebase, I've confirmed that the service layer has already been successfully updated to use the pure functions from `src/game/pureGameLogic.ts`. Here's what I found:

### ✅ Services Successfully Updated:

**1. TurnService (`src/services/TurnService.ts`)**
- ✅ Uses `checkGameCompletionPure` for game completion checks
- ✅ Uses `checkSeasonCompletionPure` for season completion checks
- ✅ Properly fetches data before calling pure functions
- ✅ Handles database updates based on pure function results

**2. GameService (`src/services/GameService.ts`)**
- ✅ Uses `checkGameCompletionPure` for game completion logic
- ✅ Properly structures input data for pure functions
- ✅ Handles results appropriately

**3. TurnOfferingService (`src/services/TurnOfferingService.ts`)**
- ✅ Uses `selectNextPlayerPure` for player selection logic
- ✅ Fetches all required data (game, season, players, turns) before calling pure function
- ✅ Handles pure function results and performs database updates

### ✅ Architecture Compliance:

1. **Data Fetching**: All services properly fetch required data from the database before calling pure functions
2. **Pure Function Calls**: Services pass structured input objects to pure functions
3. **Result Handling**: Services handle pure function results and perform database updates accordingly
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is maintained throughout the flow
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data access (services) and business logic (pure functions)

### ✅ No Remaining Work:

- ❌ No imports from old impure game logic files found
- ❌ No direct calls to old placeholder functions found
- ❌ No command handlers or other components using old functions

The service layer refactoring to use pure functions has been completed successfully. All database operations are handled in the service layer, while business logic is properly delegated to the pure functions.

## 5. Remove Legacy Impure Functions and Update Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 41.4
### Description: Delete old impure functions and update or add tests to reflect the new architecture. Ensure all documentation is current and provides guidance on the new separation of concerns.
### Details:
Clean up obsolete code, update test suites, and document the new function signatures and usage patterns for future maintainability.
<info added on 2025-05-25T21:22:57.114Z>
## Analysis Complete: Legacy Functions and Tests Identified

### 🔍 Legacy Functions Still Present
The following placeholder functions still exist and need to be removed:

**src/game/gameLogic.ts:**
- `activateSeasonPlaceholder()` - replaced by `activateSeasonPure()`

**src/game/playerLogic.ts:**
- `addPlayerPlaceholder()` - replaced by `processPlayerOperationPure()`

**src/game/turnLogic.ts:**
- `claimTurnPlaceholder()` - replaced by `validateTurnClaimPure()` + `processTurnClaimPure()`
- `submitTurnPlaceholder()` - replaced by validation + processing functions
- `offerTurnPlaceholder()` - replaced by validation + processing functions
- `skipTurnPlaceholder()` - replaced by validation + processing functions
- `dismissOfferPlaceholder()` - replaced by validation + processing functions

**src/game/seasonLogic.ts:**
- `createSeasonPlaceholder()` - replaced by validation + processing functions

### 🧪 Tests Still Using Legacy Functions
The following test files are importing and testing the old placeholder functions:
- `tests/game/playerLogic.unit.test.ts` - imports `addPlayerPlaceholder`
- `tests/game/turnLogic.unit.test.ts` - imports all turn placeholder functions
- `tests/game/seasonLogic.unit.test.ts` - imports `createSeasonPlaceholder`
- `tests/game/gameLogic.unit.test.ts` - imports `activateSeasonPlaceholder`

### 📋 Action Plan
1. Remove all placeholder functions from game logic files
2. Update tests to test pure functions instead of placeholder functions
3. Ensure all tests still pass
4. Update any remaining documentation references

Continuing Test Updates - Fixing Import Errors

Current status: playerLogic and seasonLogic tests are fully updated and passing. Working on turnLogic tests which have import errors.

Issue Found: turnLogic tests are trying to import pure functions from turnLogic.js instead of pureGameLogic.js. Need to fix these imports and complete the test updates.

Next Steps:
1. Fix import errors in turnLogic tests
2. Complete turnLogic test updates
3. Update gameLogic tests
4. Verify all tests pass

<info added on 2025-05-25T21:48:20.957Z>
**Fixing Wrapper Function Interfaces**

Found the issue with gameLogic tests - the wrapper functions need to match the expected interfaces and use the correct input types for the pure functions. The pure functions expect specific data structures:

- `selectNextPlayerPure` expects `SelectNextPlayerInput` with `gameData`, `seasonPlayers`, `allSeasonGames`, `turnType`
- `checkGameCompletionPure` expects `CheckGameCompletionInput` with `gameId`, `seasonPlayers`, `completedOrSkippedTurns`
- Other functions have similar specific input requirements

Need to restructure the wrapper functions to:
1. Fetch the correct data from database
2. Transform it into the expected input format
3. Call the pure functions with correct parameters
4. Return results in the format expected by tests

Next Steps:
1. Fix import errors in turnLogic tests (already identified)
2. Complete turnLogic test updates
3. Update gameLogic tests by fixing wrapper function interfaces
4. Verify all tests pass
