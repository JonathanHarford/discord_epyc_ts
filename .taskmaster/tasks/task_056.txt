# Task ID: 56
# Title: Fix Completed Games Channel Link Display
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the completed games announcement message to use the correct Discord channel mention format (<#channelId>) instead of plain text, making the channel link clickable.
# Details:
Locate the code responsible for generating the game completion announcement message. This is likely within a service related to game management or messaging. Identify where the plain text channel name "#finished-games" is being used. Retrieve the actual channel ID for the finished games channel. This ID might be stored in configuration, environment variables, or require fetching via the Discord API. Modify the message construction logic to use the Discord channel mention format `<#channelId>`, replacing `channelId` with the retrieved ID. Ensure robust handling for cases where the channel ID might be missing or invalid.

# Test Strategy:
1. Trigger a game completion event to send the announcement message.
2. Navigate to the channel where the completed games announcement is posted.
3. Verify that the channel name is displayed as a clickable link.
4. Click the link to confirm it correctly navigates to the finished games channel.
5. Check the bot logs for any errors related to message sending or channel ID retrieval.
6. If possible, test in a development environment with different channel configurations.
