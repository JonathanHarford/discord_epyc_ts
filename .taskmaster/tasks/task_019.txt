# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Season Completion Check
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: The core logic for checking season completion after a game is marked as COMPLETED has been implemented and integrated. This check verifies if all games within a season are completed and updates the season status accordingly.
# Details:
The season completion check is triggered automatically after a game transitions to the COMPLETED state in both `submitTurn` and `skipTurn` methods. It utilizes the existing `checkSeasonCompletion` function (formerly a placeholder). The implementation includes robust error handling to prevent failures from disrupting turn processing and comprehensive logging for visibility. The season status is automatically updated to 'COMPLETED' when all constituent games are finished.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive unit and integration tests have been developed and verified. These tests cover scenarios including season completion triggered by turn submission, skipping turns, mixed completion methods, and error handling during the check. All existing tests pass, and new integration tests confirm correct season status transitions.
