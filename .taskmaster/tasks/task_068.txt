# Title: Fix Drawing Turn Pattern Start
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Fix a bug where games with the 'drawing,writing' turn pattern incorrectly start with a writing turn instead of a drawing turn.
# Details:
Investigate the game initialization and turn assignment logic for games with the 'drawing,writing' turn pattern. Identify where the first turn type is determined based on the pattern and correct the logic to ensure that when the pattern is 'drawing,writing', the very first turn requested from a player is always a drawing turn. This might involve examining the code that parses the turn pattern string or the state machine that transitions the game to the first turn.

# Test Strategy:
1. Start a new game with the turn pattern explicitly set to 'drawing,writing'.
2. Observe the first turn request sent to the initial player.
3. Verify that the system requests a drawing turn.
4. Repeat the test multiple times to ensure consistency.
5. Optionally, test other turn patterns (e.g., 'writing,drawing') to ensure this fix doesn't introduce regressions.
