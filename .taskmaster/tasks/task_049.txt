# Task ID: 49
# Title: Implement Interactive Season List (A2)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 47, 48
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the `/season list` command output to display each season with interactive buttons for actions like 'Show Details' and 'Join' (conditionally available).
# Details:
Modify the `/season list` command output generation in `season-command.ts`. For each season listed, create an `ActionRowBuilder` containing `ButtonBuilder` instances. Include a 'Show' button (`customId: season_show_${season.id}`). Conditionally include a 'Join' button (`customId: season_join_${season.id}`) that is enabled only if the season is active and the interacting user is not already a participant. Reuse or adapt the `season_join_` button handler logic from task 48. Create a new `ButtonHandler` for `season_show_` to trigger the `/season show` command logic or display season details. Ensure proper pagination or handling for many seasons.

# Test Strategy:
Run `/season list`. Verify each season entry has the correct buttons. Test clicking 'Show' on a season. Test clicking 'Join' on an active season you are not in. Verify the 'Join' button is disabled for seasons you are already in or inactive seasons.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Refactor /season list Output Generation [done]
### Dependencies: None

## 3. Implement Conditional 'Join' Button and Handler Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 49.1
### Description: Add a 'Join' button (`customId: season_join_${season.id}`) for each season, enabled only if the season is active and the user is not already a participant. Integrate or adapt the button handler logic from task 48.
### Details:
Ensure the 'Join' button is conditionally rendered and enabled, and that it correctly triggers the join logic.

## 4. Implement Pagination or Overflow Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 49.1
### Description: Add pagination or another mechanism to handle cases where there are many seasons, ensuring the list remains user-friendly and navigable.

Choose and implement a strategy (pagination, scrolling, etc.) to manage long season lists.

## 5. Comprehensive Testing and Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 49.2, 49.3, 49.4
### Description: Perform end-to-end testing of the enhanced `/season list` command, including all button interactions, conditional logic, and overflow handling.
