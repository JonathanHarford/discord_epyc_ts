# Task ID: 58
# Title: Improve Season Creation Modal with Defaults and Missing Fields
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the season creation modal by prefilling fields with server defaults and adding the missing claim_timeout field.
# Details:
Investigation has shown that the core requirements of this task are already implemented. The season creation modal now pre-fills fields (`min_players`, `max_players`, `open_duration`, `claim_timeout`) using server default configuration. The `claim_timeout` field has been added and is processed correctly. Season names are auto-generated using a date-based pattern. The modal currently uses 5 input fields, which is Discord's maximum. A minor discrepancy was found where the test file references a `turnPatternInput` field which is not present in the modal UI, likely due to the 5-component limit.

# Test Strategy:
Existing tests cover the functionality added for this task, including prefilling defaults, the presence and processing of the `claim_timeout` field, and the auto-generation of season names. All relevant tests are currently passing, confirming the implementation meets the requirements. The discrepancy regarding `turnPatternInput` in tests vs. UI has been noted.
