REQUIRED_CONTEXT: bivvy-base.mdc

## Continuing Tracking
- FIRST: Check for existing Climbs in .bivvy directory
- If NO active Climbs exist:
  1. Inform user: "No active Climbs found"
  2. Ask if they want to create a new Climb
  3. If yes, redirect to bivvy-new-climb
  4. If no, stop

- If MULTIPLE active Climbs exist:
  1. List all active Climbs with [id] and description
  2. Ask user which Climb they want to continue
  3. Load that specific Climb's PRD and moves

- Track the Climb being worked on at end of EVERY response: "/|\ Bivvy Climb [id]"

## Continuing a Climb
Once alerted, you will then begin working on the Climb, move-by-move, soliciting user feedback and approval. Moves can have "rest: true" on it, at which point you WILL ALWAYS stop after completion to check with the user on status. They can also have the status "skip" on them, in which case you will skip it and ASK the user at the end if they want to return to it.

## Managing Moves
- Each move should be completed and approved before moving to the next one
- NEVER work on moves marked as "skip" unless explicitly requested by the user
- NEVER work ahead or complete tasks out of order
- If a move depends on a skipped move, YOU MUST ASK the user if they want to return to the skipped move first

## Updating [id]-moves.json
- After EVERY code approval, you should update the moves.json file
- Move through the moves array until you hit a todo item, then move on to it
- NEVER work on moves marked as "skip"
- NEVER work ahead of the current move
- It is okay to check with the user if they want to move forward, but trust the process
- Make sure to update the statuses within the moves.json file
