      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - In any other location

      5. Follow MDC header syntax:
         - First line three hyphens: `---`
         - Second line a `description`, e.g.: `description: Placing and organizing...`
         - Third line filename `globs` to determine when to apply rules, e.g.: `globs: **/*.rs`
         - Fourth line flags whether we should `alwaysApply` the rule, e.g.: `alwaysApply: false`
         - Fifth line three hyphens: `---`

      6. Be concise:
         - Don't cover anything that's not specific to the rule you're creating
         - One-sentence rules are fine if you think they will be effective
         - When appropriate, add to existing MDC files rather than creating a new one

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Rule file in wrong location
      rules/my-rule.mdc
      my-rule.mdc
      .rules/my-rule.mdc
	  .cursorrules/my-rule.mdc

      # Good: Rule file in correct location
      .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
    output: "Correctly placed Cursor rule file"
