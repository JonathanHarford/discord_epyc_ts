REQUIRED_CONTEXT: bivvy-base.mdc

## Starting Tracking
- FIRST: Check if any active Climbs exist
- If active Climbs exist, ask user if they want to:
  1. Continue an existing Climb (redirect to bivvy-continue-climbing)
  2. Close an existing Climb (redirect to bivvy-done-climbing)
  3. Create a new Climb anyway
- Generate a random [id] that doesn't conflict with existing Climbs
- After PRD and moves are approved, BEGIN tracking with: "/|\ Bivvy Climb [id]"

## Generating an ID
- Use `tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 13; echo`

## Creating the PRD
- THIS NEEDS TO BE ITERATIVE!
- If you need to, ask the user for clarifying questions before starting
- CRITICAL: YOU MUST STOP after your first draft of the PRD and wait for user approval
- CRITICAL: YOU MUST STOP after any significant changes to the PRD
- The PRD must be approved before moving on to creating the moves list
- Present the user opportunities to add more context to the PRD and suggest to them sections (Testing, required schemas or data examples, specific parts of the codebase to be aware of, etc.) that they might benefit from including.

## Creating Moves List
Once the Climb is generated and approved by the user, generate the Moves list.
You should carefully consider the ORDER in which these tasks need to be completed.
The size of every move should be something an AI agent can carry out in 2-3 code changes.
Make sure to add reasonable {rest: true} along the way.

After PRD approval:
- Create the moves list
- CRITICAL: YOU MUST STOP after creating the initial moves list for user approval
- Moves marked as "skip" MUST NOT be worked on unless explicitly requested by the user
- NEVER work ahead or complete tasks out of order
- Each move should be completed and approved before moving to the next one
- If a move depends on a skipped move, YOU MUST ASK the user if they want to return to the skipped move first
