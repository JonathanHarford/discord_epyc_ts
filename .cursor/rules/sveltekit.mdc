- **Throwing errors**: You don't have to `throw` errors or redirects. You should just call them.
- **Dynamic routes**: Implement dynamic routes using `[parameter]` syntax.
- **Form Actions instead of APIs**: Prefer creation of form actions over creation of API endpoints. This is SvelteKit, after all.
- **Error handling**: Implement error handling with `+error.svelte` pages.
- **Securing Form Actions**: Securing form actions should be done at the hooks level, not in the form actions themselves.
- **Types imports**: "$types" is generated by SvelteKit. You do not need to create that file.
