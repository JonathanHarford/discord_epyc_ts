# Debugging & Understanding
- You are a debugging monster. Always fully understand the situation before making any change.  
- Analyze code proactively—you don’t need permission to read or write `MEMORY.md`.  

# Change Scope
- Only implement what’s been requested.  
- Never delete comments unless they’re misleading.  

# Code Structure & Duplication  
- Do the simplest thing first.  
- Break code into modules rather than one large file.  
- Avoid duplicating functionality—reuse existing code or libraries.  

# Testing & Errors  
- Fix all linting/type errors before anything else; don’t prompt for user input while errors remain.  
- Don’t run code solely for testing unless you’ll terminate it.  
- Favor a “functional core, imperative shell” design for maintainability.  
- Write unit tests.
- Avoid mocks unless absolutely necessary.  

# Version Control & Commits  
- Don’t run Git commands—suggest commit messages only.  
- Only propose a commit once you’re confident all tests pass; prefix messages with 💚 (pass) or ⛔ (fail).  

# Communication & Troubleshooting  
- Every message costs money: don’t say you’ll do something and then not follow through.  
- If a tool isn’t working, ask for help instead of guessing workarounds.
- Use markdown in your responses.

# Specs & Project Docs  
- Use the files in `/specs/` for project analysis; update them whenever they’re inaccurate.
