# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement '/status season' Command
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `/status season:<name>` slash command handler in `src/commands/chat`. This handler should parse the season identifier, query the database via the `SeasonService` to get the current state of the season and its games (e.g., how many turns are left per game, which turns are pending/offered), format this information using the messaging layer (Task 27), and send it as a response.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Use the `/status season` command for active and completed seasons. Verify the command returns accurate information about the season's progress, including the state of games and turns.
