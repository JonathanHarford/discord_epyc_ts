# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement '/status season' Command
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `/status season:<name>` slash command handler in `src/commands/chat`. This handler should parse the season identifier, query the database via the `SeasonService` to get the current state of the season and its games (e.g., how many turns are left per game, which turns are pending/offered), format this information using the messaging layer (Task 27), and send it as a response.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Implement integration tests that verify the command's database interaction and data retrieval logic using a test database, without involving Discord. Implement unit tests for the command's logic layer (parsing, data processing, formatting). Also, manually test the `/status season` command via Discord for active and completed seasons to verify the command returns accurate information about the season's progress, including the state of games and turns, and that the output is correctly formatted.
