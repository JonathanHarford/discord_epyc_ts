# Task ID: 27
# Title: Refine and Integrate Messaging Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refine and fully implement the messaging layer (`src/messaging/`) as described in the architecture. This layer is responsible for taking structured data payloads and message instructions from the service layer and generating the final, user-facing strings for all bot replies (DMs, public channel messages, ephemeral messages). Integrate i18n if planned, otherwise use simple string formatting. Ensure all command handlers and DM processing logic use this layer for output.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Review all user-facing messages generated by the bot. Verify they are consistently formatted and generated via the messaging layer. Test messages with different data payloads to ensure correct formatting.
