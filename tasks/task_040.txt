# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Enhanced Messaging in TurnService
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 10, 37, 38
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace basic string messages in TurnService with enhanced messaging using a messaging layer/utility, incorporating dynamic data like claim timeout duration.
# Details:
Modify the `TurnService` class, specifically addressing TODO comments related to message construction (e.g., lines 65-66 in the original context). Instead of using simple string literals for messages sent via DM (like turn offers or timeout notifications), integrate with a messaging utility or framework. This utility should allow for structured message creation, potentially supporting i18n in the future. For messages related to turn offers and claim timeouts, fetch the actual configured claim timeout duration (available via Task 37) and include it dynamically in the message text. Ensure the messages are clear and informative for the player.

# Test Strategy:
1. Manually trigger a turn offer scenario (e.g., via season activation or completing a previous turn). Verify the DM sent to the player uses the new messaging format and correctly displays the claim timeout duration. 2. Configure different claim timeout durations in season settings or configuration. Repeat the turn offer scenario and confirm the displayed timeout duration in the message updates accordingly. 3. If a basic messaging utility is implemented, ensure it handles simple string replacement correctly.
