# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Admin Command: Terminate Season
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `/admin terminate season:<id>` slash command handler in `src/commands/chat`. This handler should include permission checks to ensure only authorized users can use it. It should call the `SeasonService` to mark the specified season as TERMINATED in the database and potentially clean up or mark related games/turns appropriately.
# Details:
As per TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md, this command implementation requires both integration tests against a test database and unit tests for the core logic.

# Test Strategy:
Implement integration tests that use a test database to verify the command handler's interaction with the `SeasonService` and database state changes (season status, related entities). Implement unit tests for the permission checks and any specific logic within the command handler itself, mocking dependencies like the `SeasonService`. Also, perform manual testing using the `/admin terminate season` command with a test season as an admin to verify the season state changes to TERMINATED in the database. Manually test using the command without admin permissions and verify it is rejected.
