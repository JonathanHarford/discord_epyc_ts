# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Claim Timeout Handler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9, 14, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the handler logic that is triggered by the Task Scheduler when a `claim_timeout` occurs for an OFFERED turn. This handler should call `TurnService.dismissOffer` to revert the turn state to AVAILABLE and then trigger the Turn Offering Mechanism (Task 14) to find and offer the turn to another eligible player.
# Details:
Implement the handler logic. Ensure comprehensive testing is included, covering both integration tests against a test database and unit tests for the core logic, as per the requirements in TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md.

# Test Strategy:
Implement integration tests using a test database to verify the handler's interaction with the database (state changes, task scheduling). Implement unit tests for the core logic within the handler and `TurnService.dismissOffer` to ensure correct state transitions and logic execution independent of the database or external services. Additionally, perform manual testing by offering a turn to a test player, letting the timeout expire, and verifying the state change and subsequent offering attempt.
