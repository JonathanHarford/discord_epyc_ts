# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Turn Offering Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the mechanism that triggers the selection and offering of the next turn. This should be called after a turn is COMPLETED or SKIPPED, or when a season is activated. It uses the Next Player Logic (Task 13) to find the next player, calls `TurnService.offerTurn` to update the state, sends the DM notification to the selected player, and schedules the claim timeout timer via the Task Scheduler.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Complete or skip a turn in a test game. Verify the Turn Offering Mechanism is triggered. Verify the correct next player is selected (using Task 13), the turn state becomes OFFERED, the player receives a DM notification, and the claim timer is scheduled.
