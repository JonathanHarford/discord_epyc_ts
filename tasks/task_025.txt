# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Basic Configuration Command ('/config seasons')
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `/config seasons [options]` slash command handler in `src/commands/chat`. This handler should allow administrators or authorized users to view the current default configuration settings for seasons (e.g., timeouts, min/max players). Optionally, allow setting these defaults, which would require persisting them (e.g., in the database or a config file).
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Use the `/config seasons` command to view current settings. If setting is implemented, test updating a setting and verifying the change is reflected.
