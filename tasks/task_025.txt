# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Basic Configuration Command ('/config seasons')
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `/config seasons [options]` slash command handler in `src/commands/chat`. This handler should allow administrators or authorized users to view the current default configuration settings for seasons (e.g., timeouts, min/max players). Optionally, allow setting these defaults, which would require persisting them (e.g., in the database or a config file).
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Implement integration tests that interact with a test database to verify command behavior without Discord interaction. Implement unit tests for the core logic layer of the command handler. Additionally, manually test the command using `/config seasons` to view current settings and, if setting is implemented, test updating a setting and verifying the change is reflected via the command and potentially direct database inspection.

Successfully registered the ConfigCommand in the bot system.

Implementation Details:
- Added ConfigCommand and AdminCommand imports to start-bot.ts
- Added both command instances to the commands array in start-bot.ts
- ConfigCommand is now properly instantiated with no dependencies (uses prisma directly)
- AdminCommand was also added as it was missing from the registration

Files Modified:
- src/start-bot.ts: Added imports and command instantiation

The config command is now fully registered and will be available when the bot starts. The command registration is complete and follows the established patterns in the codebase.
