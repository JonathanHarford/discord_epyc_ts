# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement GameService Methods
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the actual GameService class with methods that support the game logic infrastructure, replacing the placeholder.
# Details:
Create the `GameService.ts` file and define the `GameService` class. This service will be responsible for managing the lifecycle of individual games within a season. Key responsibilities will include: creating new game instances when a season starts or a previous game ends (if applicable), coordinating the flow of turns by interacting with `TurnService`, checking the status of a game (e.g., completed), and providing methods for other parts of the application (like command handlers or event listeners) to interact with the current game state. Define core methods such as `createGame(seasonId: string): Promise<Game>`, `getGameStatus(gameId: string): Promise<GameStatus>`, `handleTurnCompletion(turnId: string): Promise<void>`, etc. Ensure the service adheres to the established service structure and principles (Task 5).

# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive unit tests for the `GameService` methods, mocking dependencies like `SeasonService` and `TurnService` to isolate the logic being tested. Verify that methods correctly update game state, interact with dependent services as expected, and handle various scenarios (e.g., game completion). Additionally, create integration tests that involve `GameService` interacting with actual (or mocked) `SeasonService` and `TurnService` instances to ensure correct coordination between services.
