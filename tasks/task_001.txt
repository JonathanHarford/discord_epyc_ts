# Task ID: 1
# Title: Define Database Schema (Prisma/PostgreSQL)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Define the database schema using Prisma for PostgreSQL, including tables for Seasons, Games, Players (within a season context), Turns, and configuration settings. Establish relationships between these entities to support the season structure (Season has Players, Season has Games, Game is in Season, Game has Turns, Turn belongs to Player). Include necessary fields for states, content, timestamps, and configurable parameters.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Verify the Prisma schema syntax is correct. Run Prisma migrations to create the database tables and ensure they match the defined models and relationships. Manually inspect the database structure.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Season and Player Models [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Prisma schema models for Season and Player entities with appropriate fields and relationships
### Details:
Define the Season model with fields for name, start/end dates, status, and configuration settings. Create the Player model with fields for name, email, status, and season association. Establish a many-to-many relationship between Seasons and Players using a join table.

The Prisma schema models for Season and Player will be defined as follows:

**Player Model**
- **id**: String, default cuid(), @id (unique identifier)
- **discordUserId**: String, @unique (links to Discord user ID)
- **name**: String (stores Discord username)
- **email**: String? (optional, as per PRD)
- **status**: String (e.g., "NOT_BANNED", "BANNED" based on PRD Player States)
- **createdAt**: DateTime, @default(now())
- **updatedAt**: DateTime, @updatedAt
- **seasons**: PlayersOnSeasons[] (for M2M with Season)
- **createdSeasons**: Season[] @relation("CreatedSeasons") (tracks seasons created by this player)
- **turns**: Turn[] (for 12M with Turn, to be defined later)

**Season Model**
- **id**: String, default cuid(), @id
- **name**: String, @unique (PRD implies unique names for seasons)
- **status**: String (e.g., "SETUP", "PENDING", "ACTIVE", "COMPLETED", "TERMINATED" - from PRD Game States, adapted for Season)
- **openDuration**: String? (e.g., "7d", from PRD Season Rules)
- **minPlayers**: Int?, default 2 (from PRD Season Rules)
- **maxPlayers**: Int? (from PRD Season Rules)
- **turnPattern**: String, default "writing,drawing" (from PRD Season Rules)
- **claimTimeout**: String, default "1d" (from PRD Season Rules)
- **writingTimeout**: String, default "1d" (from PRD Season Rules)
- **writingWarning**: String, default "1m" (from PRD Season Rules)
- **drawingTimeout**: String, default "1d" (from PRD Season Rules)
- **drawingWarning**: String, default "10m" (from PRD Season Rules)
- **createdAt**: DateTime, @default(now())
- **updatedAt**: DateTime, @updatedAt
- **games**: Game[] (for 12M with Game, to be defined later)
- **players**: PlayersOnSeasons[] (for M2M with Player)
- **creatorId**: String (Foreign key to Player who created the season)
- **creator**: Player @relation("CreatedSeasons", fields: [creatorId], references: [id])

**Join Table for Player-Season M2M (PlayersOnSeasons)**
- **player**: Player @relation(fields: [playerId], references: [id])
- **playerId**: String
- **season**: Season @relation(fields: [seasonId], references: [id])
- **seasonId**: String
- **assignedAt**: DateTime, @default(now())
- **@@id([playerId, seasonId])** (Composite primary key)

This structure addresses the requirements for Season and Player models and their M2M relationship. Configuration settings are included as fields in the Season model as per PRD Season Rules. Fields for Game and Turn relationships are noted as placeholders for subsequent subtasks. Using String for IDs with cuid() as Prisma/PostgreSQL doesn't have a native UUID type that auto-increments in the same way as uuid() with uuid_generate_v4() without extensions, and cuid() is a good Prisma-recommended default. Player status from PRD: "NOT_BANNED", "BANNED". Season status derived from PRD "Game States": "SETUP", "PENDING", "ACTIVE", "COMPLETED", "TERMINATED". The PRD mentions "name, email, status, and season association" for Player. discordUserId is added for a reliable link to the Discord entity. name can store the Discord username. The PRD mentions "name, start/end dates, status, and configuration settings" for Season. Start/end dates are covered by createdAt/updatedAt and game/turn progression. Configuration settings from PRD "Season Rules" are added as fields directly to the Season model. The creator relation links a Season back to the Player who initiated it.

## 2. Define Game and Turn Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create Prisma schema models for Game and Turn entities with appropriate fields and relationships
### Details:
Define the Game model with fields for title, status, start/end times, and season association. Create the Turn model with fields for content, status, timestamps, and associations to both Game and Player. Establish one-to-many relationships between Games and Turns.

## 3. Implement Configuration Settings Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Create a dedicated model for storing configurable parameters that affect season and game behavior
### Details:
Define a Configuration model with fields for parameter names, values, types, and descriptions. Create relationships to link configurations to specific Seasons or make them global. Include default values and validation rules.

## 4. Establish Cross-Entity Relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Define and implement all relationships between models to support the required data structure
### Details:
Implement relations between Season-Game (one-to-many), Season-Player (many-to-many), Game-Turn (one-to-many), and Turn-Player (many-to-one). Use Prisma's @relation attribute with appropriate fields and references directives. Add indexes for performance optimization.

## 5. Add Database Constraints and Indexes [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Implement necessary constraints and indexes to maintain data integrity and query performance
### Details:
Add unique constraints for Season names, Player emails within seasons, and Game titles within seasons. Create indexes for frequently queried fields like status, timestamps, and foreign keys. Implement cascading deletes where appropriate to maintain referential integrity.
