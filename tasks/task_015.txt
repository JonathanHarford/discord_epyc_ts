# Task ID: 15
# Title: Integrate Task Scheduler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate a Task Scheduler component into the bot architecture. This component is responsible for scheduling and triggering events based on time limits, specifically for claim timeouts (`claim_timeout`) and submission timeouts (`writing_timeout`, `drawing_timeout`) as defined in the season rules. It should be reliable and ideally persist scheduled tasks across bot restarts.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Implement basic scheduling and triggering. Schedule a simple task for a short duration. Verify the task is executed at the correct time. Test scheduling multiple tasks.
