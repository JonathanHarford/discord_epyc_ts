# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Admin Commands: List Seasons/Players
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `/admin list seasons` and `/admin list players` slash command handlers in `src/commands/chat`. These handlers should include permission checks. They should query the database via the service layer to retrieve lists of active seasons and players (potentially filtered by season or status) and display this information.
# Details:
As per TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md, this command implementation requires both integration tests against a test database and unit tests for the command's core logic.

# Test Strategy:
Implement integration tests that verify the command logic interacts correctly with a test database to retrieve season and player data. Implement unit tests for the command's logic layer (e.g., data formatting, permission checks). Manually test the `/admin list seasons` and `/admin list players` commands as an admin in a development environment to verify they return lists of seasons and players currently in the database via Discord.
