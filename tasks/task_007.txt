# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement '/join season' Command
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `/join season:<id>` slash command handler in `src/commands/chat`. This handler should parse the season ID, call the `SeasonService` to add the user as a player to the specified season in the database, and validate that the season is in a state allowing players to join (e.g., not closed or active). Provide informative feedback to the user.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Use the `/join season` command with valid and invalid season IDs. Verify players are added to the season in the database when valid. Test joining a season that is closed or doesn't exist and verify appropriate error messages are returned.
