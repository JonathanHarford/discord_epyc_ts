# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Submission Timeout Handler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9, 14, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the handler logic that is triggered by the Task Scheduler when a `writing_timeout` or `drawing_timeout` occurs for a PENDING turn. This handler should call `TurnService.skipTurn` to update the turn state to SKIPPED, send a DM notification to the player informing them they were skipped, and then trigger the Turn Offering Mechanism (Task 14) to find and offer the turn to another eligible player.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Have a test player claim a turn (PENDING) but do not have them submit content. Set a short submission timeout. Verify that after the timeout, the turn state changes to SKIPPED, the player receives a skipped message DM, and the Turn Offering Mechanism attempts to find another player.
