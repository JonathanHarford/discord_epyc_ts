# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Season Next Player Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the core Next Player Logic algorithm for Season Games as detailed in the PRD (`MUSTs` and `SHOULDs`). This logic, likely residing in `src/game/` or `GameService`, determines which player should be OFFERED the next AVAILABLE turn in a specific game, considering who has played, turn types, and avoiding multiple pending turns for one player.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive tests as per TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md:
1.  Write unit tests specifically for the core logic layer function(s) that determine the next player. These tests should cover various scenarios: a new game, mid-game with players available, end-game with few players left, scenarios where players have pending turns, scenarios after a player is skipped. Verify the correct player is selected according to the PRD rules.
2.  Write integration tests that interact with a test database to ensure the logic functions correctly within the application context, considering database state changes and interactions.
