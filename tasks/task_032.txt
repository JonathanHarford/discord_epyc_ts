# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Tests for /new season Command
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 30, 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive integration and unit tests for the /new season command, covering SeasonService.createSeason and related logic, including success and various error scenarios.
# Details:
Implement integration tests for `SeasonService.createSeason` focusing on interactions with the database. These tests should verify successful season creation, handling of duplicate season names, and cases where the creator ID might not exist. Ensure these tests assert that the service returns the correct `MessageInstruction` objects as implemented in Task 30. Additionally, write unit tests for any pure logic functions used by the `/new season` command handler or `SeasonService.createSeason` that are suitable for isolation. The tests should cover edge cases and invalid inputs where applicable. Leverage the test database setup for integration tests. Ensure tests are well-structured and easy to understand.

# Test Strategy:
Run all newly created integration and unit tests using the standard test runner. Verify that all tests pass for successful creation, duplicate name errors, creator not found errors, and any other implemented error conditions. Check test coverage metrics to ensure adequate coverage of the `SeasonService.createSeason` function and the relevant parts of the `/new season` command handler and associated logic. Manually test the `/new season` command in a development environment to confirm that the user feedback via the Lang service (implemented in Task 31) correctly reflects the outcomes tested by the automated tests.
