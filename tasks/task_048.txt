# Task ID: 48
# Title: Implement Season Join Button (A1)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 47
# Priority: high
# Description: Add an interactive 'Join Season' button to the success message displayed after a new season is created, allowing users to join with a single click.
# Details:
Modify the season creation success message generation in `season-command.ts`. Use `discord.js`'s `ButtonBuilder` and `ActionRowBuilder` to create a primary style button with a `customId` formatted as `season_join_${seasonId}`. Add this action row to the message components. Create a new `ButtonHandler` implementation that listens for `customId` starting with `season_join_`. In the handler, extract the `seasonId` from the `customId`, validate the user and season, and call the existing `SeasonService.addPlayerToSeason()` method. Provide user feedback (e.g., ephemeral reply) upon successful join or error.

# Test Strategy:
Create a new season using the command. Verify the success message includes the 'Join Season' button. Click the button as a different user and confirm they are added to the season. Test clicking the button multiple times or by users already in the season to ensure correct error handling.
