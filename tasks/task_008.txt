# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Season Activation Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the logic responsible for transitioning a season from PENDING (waiting for players) to ACTIVE. This logic should be triggered either when the `max_players` limit is reached or when the `open_duration` timeout expires (requires Task Scheduler). Upon activation, create N games for N players in the season and trigger the initial turn OFFERs for each player via DM.

# Test Strategy:
Create a season with `min_players` and `max_players` set. Join players until `max_players` is reached and verify the season activates, games are created, and initial turns are offered. Create a season with `open_duration` and verify it activates after the duration passes if `min_players` is met. Verify initial turns are offered.
