# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Season Activation Logic
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the logic responsible for transitioning a season from PENDING (waiting for players) to ACTIVE. This logic should be triggered either when the `max_players` limit is reached or when the `open_duration` timeout expires (requires Task Scheduler). Upon activation, create N games for N players in the season and trigger the initial turn OFFERs for each player via DM.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive tests including unit tests for core logic, integration tests verifying database interactions, and end-to-end tests simulating player joins and timeout scenarios. Verify season status transitions, game creation, player assignments, and initial turn offers (including Discord DMs in end-to-end tests).
