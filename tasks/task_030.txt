# Title: Modify SeasonService.createSeason for Message Instructions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update `SeasonService.createSeason` to return structured message instruction objects for both success and error outcomes, facilitating user feedback via the Lang service.
# Details:
Modify the `SeasonService.createSeason` method to return a structured object representing a message instruction, rather than the created season object or throwing raw errors. Define a standard interface or type for `MessageInstruction` (e.g., `{ type: 'success' | 'error', key: string, data?: Record<string, any> }`) that can be used across services. On successful season creation, return a success instruction object including relevant season details (like ID and name) for the message. On failure (e.g., validation errors, database issues), catch the error and return an error instruction object with an appropriate message key and relevant error data. Ensure all potential error paths within `createSeason` are handled by returning an error instruction.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for `SeasonService.createSeason`. Test the successful creation path, verifying that the method returns a success `MessageInstruction` object with the correct `type`, a specific success `key` (e.g., 'season_created_success'), and that the `data` property contains expected details of the created season (e.g., `id`, `name`). Test various failure paths, including invalid input data (e.g., missing name, invalid format) and simulated internal errors (e.g., database write failure), verifying that the method returns an error `MessageInstruction` object with `type: 'error'`, an appropriate error `key` (e.g., 'validation_error', 'database_error'), and relevant error details in the `data` property. Ensure that the method does not throw exceptions directly for handled errors.
