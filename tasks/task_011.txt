# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement '/ready' Command Handling (DM)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the handler for the `/ready` command when used in a Direct Message. This handler should validate that the user has a turn currently in the OFFERED state. If valid, call `TurnService.claimTurn` to update the turn state to PENDING (ASSIGNED), cancel the associated claim timeout timer via the Task Scheduler, and schedule the appropriate submission timeout timer (writing or drawing). Send a confirmation DM to the player.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Offer a turn to a test player. Have the player use `/ready` in DM. Verify the turn state changes to PENDING in the DB. Verify the claim timer is cancelled and a submission timer is scheduled via the Task Scheduler. Test using `/ready` when no turn is offered and verify an error message is returned.
