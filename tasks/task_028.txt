# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of all implemented MVP features. This includes writing unit tests for pure logic functions (`src/game/`), integration tests for services and command handlers, and manual end-to-end testing of the full season game flow, including season creation, joining, turn taking (writing/drawing), `/ready` command, timeouts (claim and submission), skipping players, game completion, season completion, and the completion announcement/DM. Test admin commands and status command. Refactor code based on testing feedback.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Execute all unit and integration tests. Perform manual testing following the Season Game Flow and Key User Flows described in the PRD. Create test scenarios specifically for risks identified (Next Player Logic complexity, Timeout handling, End-of-Season edge cases). Document test results and bugs.
