# Priority: medium
# Description: Automated comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E, service) and code refinement based on feedback have been successfully completed. The focus of this task is now on conducting manual testing of Discord integration features (bot connection, slash commands, DMs) to ensure proper functionality within the Discord environment.
# Details:
Automated testing covered all major components and flows, resulting in 487 passing tests. This included 24 files of unit tests, 8 files of integration tests, 3 files of end-to-end tests, and 6 files of service tests. Key areas tested include season/game flows, turn management, admin functions, configuration, next player logic, error handling, and database operations. The build is clean with no errors. Testing documentation, including a manual testing plan (`scripts/manual-testing-plan.md`) and summary (`scripts/testing-summary.md`), has been created. The bot is ready for manual Discord integration testing.

# Test Strategy:
Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests have been executed and are passing. The remaining test strategy focuses on manual testing within the Discord environment. This includes verifying bot connection, executing all slash commands (`/season`, `/join`, `/ready`, `/status`, `/admin`, etc.), confirming correct DM delivery for turn notifications, claims, submissions, and game/season completion announcements. Follow the manual testing plan (`scripts/manual-testing-plan.md`) for specific scenarios. Document any issues found during manual testing.
