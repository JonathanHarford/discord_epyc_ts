# Bivvy Quickstart

Bivvy manages your coding tasks through "Climbs". Here's all you need to know:

1. **Start**: "Let's start a new Climb"
   - Describe your task
   - Review the plan & tasks

2. **Work**: The AI will guide you through each task
   - Approve changes as you go
   - Look for "/|\ Bivvy Climb [id]" to track progress

3. **Resume/Complete**:
   - "Let's continue the Climb" to resume
   - "Let's close this Climb" when done

For best results, reference the rule directly: @bivvy-new-climb
